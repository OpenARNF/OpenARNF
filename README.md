Desktop version is currently completely inferior to the official one, get it [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/603530/A_Robot_Named_Fight/) instead, it has no DRM and is not expensive.

# Original README from the ARNF Creator

A Robot Named Fight first launched on Steam on September 7th, 2017. Since then we've built a large, wonderful fan-base, released multiple free updates, and more than doubled the amount of content featured in the game. It's been an amazing 5 years of A Robot Named Fight.

As of September 30th, 2022, I'm releasing the unity project files for A Robot Named Fight to the public. The game and the source code are being provided for aspiring game developers and hobbyist to explore, learn from, and innovate upon.

I can't wait to see what y'all create!
